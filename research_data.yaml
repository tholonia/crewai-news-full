Bioelectromagnetism is a field that explores the electrical and magnetic phenomena in biological systems. The cited works by M.W. Ho, F.A. Popp, U. Warnke, R. Lumry, G.R. Welch, I. Havel, among others, contribute to our understanding of this field through various studies on bioelectromagnetic interactions, biophoton research, and the implications for cellular processes and communication within living organisms. These references collectively suggest that bioelectromagnetism plays a significant role in physiological functions and may have potential applications in medical diagnostics and therapeutics.
